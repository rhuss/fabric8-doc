## Getting Started

There are 2 main ways to get started.

### OpenShift

The ideal linux based platform for running Fabric8 is OpenShift V3:

The easiest way to get started with OpenShift is with Docker:

* [Getting started with OpenShift v3 using Docker](openShiftDocker.html)
  * [Running a quickstart on OpenShift](http://fabric8.io/v2/example.html)
  * [Add a quickstart to the App Library](quickstarts.html)
* [Troubleshooting with OpenShift](troubleshooting.html)

### Jube

The easiest as a Java developer is to start with [Jube](jube.html); since you've probably already got Java and Maven installed so you're almost ready to go:

* [Get Started with Jube](getStartedJube.html)
  * [Running a quickstart on Jube](jubeRunQuickstart.html)
  * [Add a quickstart to the App Library](jubeAddQuickstartApp.html)
* [Troubleshooting with Jube](http://fabric8.io/jube/troubleshooting.html)

### Troubleshooting

Hopefully that will get you started quickly; if you hit any issues check out the [FAQ](http://fabric8.io/v2/FAQ.html), [get in touch](http://fabric8.io/community/index.html) or [raise an issue](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/issues)
