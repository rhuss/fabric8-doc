## Get Started with OpenShift V3 and Fabric8

Here are the steps to get started using OpenShift V3 and Fabric8:

### Setup OpenShift

There are a few ways you can do this part. 

* [Use the OpenShift Origin documentation](http://docs.openshift.org/latest/welcome/index.html)
* [Start OpenShift V3 using Vagrant](openShiftVagrant.html)
* [Start OpenShift V3 using Docker](openShiftDocker.html)

Or you could try install OpenShift directly on your laptop. Note that this currently only works on Linux (but hopefully will be fixed soon!):

* [Install OpenShift V3 locally](openShiftInstall.html)

### Use OpenShift

Now lets run the Fabric8 services and deploy an application:

1. [Deploy an example quickstart project](http://fabric8.io/guide/example.html)
1. [Check out the Quickstarts](quickstarts.html)

Steps 1 and 2 only need to be done once per machine.

Hopefully that will get you started quickly; if you hit any issues check out the [FAQ](http://fabric8.io/guide/FAQ.html), [get in touch](http://fabric8.io/community/index.html) or [raise an issue](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/issues)
