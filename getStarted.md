## Getting Started

There are 2 main ways to get started.

### Jube

The easiest as a Java developer is to start with [Jube](jube.html); since you've probably already got Java and Maven installed so you're almost ready to go:

* [Get Started with Jube](getStartedJube.html)
  * [Running a quickstart on Jube](jubeRunQuickstart.html)
  * [Add a quickstart to the App Library](jubeAddQuickstartApp.html)
* [Troubleshooting Jube](http://fabric8.io/jube/troubleshooting.html)

### OpenShift

The ideal linux based platform for running Fabric8 is OpenShift V3:

If you are not running a modern Linux we recommend you start with OpenShift on docker:

* [Start OpenShift V3 using Docker](openShiftDocker.html)

If you want to test a multi-minion system then we recommend you try vagrant:

* [Start OpenShift V3 using Vagrant](openShiftVagrant.html)

Or you could try install OpenShift directly on your laptop. Note that this currently only works on Linux (but hopefully will be fixed soon!):

* [Install OpenShift V3 locally](openShiftInstall.html)

#### Deploy a quickstart

Once you have OpenShift running from one of the above methods you can now try to deploy an application:

1. [Deploy an example quickstart project](http://fabric8.io/v2/example.html)
1. [Check out the Quickstarts](quickstarts.html)

### Troubleshooting

Hopefully that will get you started quickly; if you hit any issues check out the [FAQ](http://fabric8.io/v2/FAQ.html), [get in touch](http://fabric8.io/community/index.html) or [raise an issue](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/issues)
