## Setup OpenShift

There are a few ways you can do this part. 

* [Use the OpenShift Origin Installation documentation](http://docs.openshift.org/latest/getting_started/dev_get_started/installation.html)

If you are not on Linux then we recommend using Vagrant:

* [Start OpenShift V3 using Vagrant](openShiftVagrant.html)

You can try using Docker too:

* [Start OpenShift V3 using Docker](openShiftDocker.html)

Or you could try install OpenShift directly on your laptop. Note that this currently only works on Linux due to the requirement for iptables etc:

* [Install OpenShift V3 locally](openShiftInstall.html)
