## Management

Fabric8 provides a number of features to help manage your software on top of Kubernetes.

* [Console](console.html) provides a nice web application based on [hawtio](http://hawt.io/) for working with your [apps](apps.html), [pods](pods.html), [replication controllers]
* [Logging](logging.html) provides consolidated logging and visualisation of log statements and events across your environment
* [Metrics](metrics.html) provides consolidated historical metric collection and visualisation across your environment
* [App Library](appLibrary.html) provides a configurable library of Apps you can easily run and install or uninstall; rather like your library of Apps on a mobile device.

Logging and metrics are key parts of being able to maintain and understand distributed systems. Consolidating log statements and events and being able to query and visualise them is an extremely useful tool. Then capturing historical metrics an extremely useful tool to help diagnose your running system.
