## Setup OpenShift

There are a few ways you can do this part. 

* [Use the OpenShift Origin documentation](http://docs.openshift.org/latest/welcome/index.html)
* [Start OpenShift V3 using Vagrant](openShiftVagrant.html)
* [Start OpenShift V3 using Docker](openShiftDocker.html)

Or you could try install OpenShift directly on your laptop. Note that this currently only works on Linux (but hopefully will be fixed soon!):

* [Install OpenShift V3 locally](openShiftInstall.html)
