## Get Started with OpenShift V3 and Fabric8

Here are the steps to get started using OpenShift V3 and Fabric8:

### Run OpenShift

There are a few ways you can do this part. If you are not running a modern Linux we recommend you start with vagrant:

1. [Start OpenShift V3 using Vagrant](vagrantOpenShift.html)

Or you could try install OpenShift directly on your laptop:

1. [Get OpenShift V3](installOpenShift.html)
1. [Setup Your Machine](setupMachine.html)


### Use OpenShift

Now lets run the Fabric8 services and deploy an application:

1. [Run Fabric8](runFabric.html)
1. [Deploy an example quickstart project](http://fabric8.io/v2/mavenPlugin.html#example)
1. [Check out the Quickstarts](quickstarts.html)

Steps 1 and 2 only need to be done once per machine.

Hopefully that will get you started quickly; if you hit any issues check out the [FAQ](http://fabric8.io/v2/FAQ.html), [get in touch](http://fabric8.io/community/index.html) or [raise an issue](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/issues)
