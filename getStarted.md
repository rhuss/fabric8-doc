## Getting Started

There are 2 main ways to get started. The easiest as a Java developer is to start with [Jube](jube.html); since you've probably already got Java and Maven installed so you're almost ready to go:

* [Get Started with Jube](getStartedJube.html)
  * [Running a quickstart on Jube](jubeRunQuickstart.html)
  * [Add a quickstart to the App Library](jubeAddQuickstartApp.html)
* [Troubleshooting Jube](http://fabric8.io/jube/troubleshooting.html)

The ideal platform for running Fabric8 is OpenShift V3 which is a little harder to setup right now (we're hoping this will get much easier soon1)

* [Get Started With OpenShift V3](getStartedOpenShift.html)
  * [Get OpenShift V3](installOpenShift.html)
  * [Setup Your Machine](setupMachine.html)
  * [Run Fabric8](runFabric.html)

Hopefully that will get you started quickly; if you hit any issues check out the [FAQ](http://fabric8.io/v2/FAQ.html), [get in touch](http://fabric8.io/community/index.html) or [raise an issue](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/issues)
