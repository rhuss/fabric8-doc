## Getting Started

There are 2 main ways to get started.

### OpenShift

The ideal linux based platform for running Fabric8 is [OpenShift V3](http://www.openshift.org/):

* [Setup OpenShift](setupOpenshift.html)
* [Install Fabric8 on OpenShift](fabric8OnOpenShift.html)

On 2.0.x we recommended using a bash script to provision OpenShift and fabric8 together:

* [Getting started with OpenShift v3 using Docker](openShiftDocker.html)

### Jube

The easiest as a Java developer is to start with [Jube](jube.html); since you've probably already got Java and Maven installed so you're almost ready to go:

* [Get Started with Jube](getStartedJube.html)
* [Troubleshooting with Jube](http://fabric8.io/jube/troubleshooting.html)

### Whats next
