## Overview

Fabric8 2.x or later provides an integration platform above [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io), [the optional kubernetes extensions defined in OpenShift Origin]() and [Docker](http://docker.io/). (For non-linux platforms which don't support docker we have a [Docker Emulation Layer](emulation.html))

The core Kubernetes abstractions are:

* [Pods](pods.html)
* [Replication Controllers](replicationControllers.html)
* [Services](services.md)

The core Kubernetes extensions defined by OpenShift Origin v3 are:

* [Apps (or Kubernetes Application Templates)](apps.html)
