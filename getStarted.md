## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with Fabric8 on your laptop is via  [Vagrant](getStartedVagrant.html) below:

### Vagrant

We highly recommend using the Fabric8 Vagrant image as the fastest way to get started:

* [Fabric8 Vagrant](getStartedVagrant.md)

### Other options
 
The ideal linux based platform for running Fabric8 is [OpenShift V3](http://www.openshift.org/):

If you already have OpenShift installed then try:

* [Install Fabric8 on OpenShift](fabric8OnOpenShift.html)

Otherwise checkout how to install OpenShift:

* [Setup OpenShift](setupOpenShift.html)

If you are Java developer then [Jube](jube.html) is an option. 

**Note** currently Jube got broken as fabric8 followed OpenShift 1.0 and Kubernetes 1.0. We will be fixing this soon ;)
